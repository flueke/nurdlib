nurdlib
=======

This is nurdlib, the NUstar ReaDout LIBrary, a big piece of code to configure,
read out, and verify readout hardware and its data, typically in a way that's
common for experiments such as those performed by the NUSTAR collaboration.


Typically:

make

will give you a debug build of the readout library in a directory named
"build_*", plus some programs that you can find in bin/.


If MBS is available, or drasi is in a directory adjacent to nurdlib, or
DRASI_PATH (see fuser/rules.mk) is set appropriately, one of:

make fuser_mbs
make fuser_drasi

will give you bin/m_read_meb.* that is sufficient to run a simple readout.


For more information:

make doc

and read build_*/doc/index.pdf.

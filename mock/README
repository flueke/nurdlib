Mock headers and libraries to explore nconf mapping branches.

This code is allowed to be simple and modern since these tests should be done
on a reasonable computer.

Run make, which will do the following:
- Build all mock libraries.
- Build one version of nurdlib for every mapping branch.
- Each version is given paths in here.
- When a build is done, the mapping branch is tested.

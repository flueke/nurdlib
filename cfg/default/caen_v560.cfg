# use_veto:
# if true: enable scaler veto before each readout and disable afterwards.
# note:
#   use_veto == true ->  counts during active veto will not be counted.
#                        this contributes to the deadtime of the module.
#   use_veto == false -> scalers will continue counting during readout cycle.
#                        readout takes ~9 us, so values may be skewed.
